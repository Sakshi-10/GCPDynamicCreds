# Overview
In todayâ€™s cloud-native world, securely managing credentials is critical. Long-lived credentials increase the risk of unauthorized access, while manual rotation complicates key management. This project showcases how to leverage short-lived tokens in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to enhance security and streamline API management.

# Why Use Dynamic Credentials?
Enhanced Security: Minimize exposure time with automatically refreshed tokens.
Fine-Grained Control: Allow users to impersonate service accounts without sharing long-lived keys.
Easy Auditing: Track actions performed with temporary credentials for better compliance.
Seamless Integration: Effortlessly integrate with your existing cloud applications.
