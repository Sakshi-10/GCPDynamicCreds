# Overview
In today’s cloud-native world, securely managing credentials is critical. Long-lived credentials increase the risk of unauthorized access, while manual rotation complicates key management. This project showcases how to leverage short-lived tokens in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to enhance security and streamline API management.

# Why Use Dynamic Credentials?

🔐 Enhanced Security: Minimize exposure time with automatically refreshed tokens.

🔐 Fine-Grained Control: Allow users to impersonate service accounts without sharing long-lived keys.

🔐 Easy Auditing: Track actions performed with temporary credentials for better compliance. 

🔐 Seamless Integration: Effortlessly integrate with your existing cloud applications.
